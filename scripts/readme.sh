    --about "Voting overcharged allows users to automatically vote on posts upon triggering various conditions.

Inspired by [Why does accepting answers not automatically upvote them?](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/422246).

Current version includes:

| Feature                              | Default  |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Auto upvoting upon accepting         | enabled  |
| Auto downvoting upon voting to close | disabled |

This is a \"living\" project, so the feature set is likely to be expanded upon in future versions."
